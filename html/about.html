                        St. Anthony of Padua, original name Fernando 
                        Martins de Bulhões, (born 1195, Lisbon, Portugal—died June 13, 1231, Arcella, Verona [Italy]; canonized 1232; 
                        feast day June 13), Franciscan friar, doctor of the church, and patron of the poor. Padua and Portugal claim him 
                        as their patron saint, and he is invoked for the return of lost property. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anthony was born into a wealthy family and was raised in the church. He joined the Augustinian canons in 1210 and probably
                        became a priest. In 1220 he joined the Franciscan order, hoping to preach to the Saracens (Muslims) and be martyred <a href="./st-anthony.html">read more... </a>

                    <p> 
                        St Anthony Catholic Church AIT Road Alagbado, is one of the parishes in the Ipaja 
                        deanary of the catholic archdiocese of Lagos. St Anthony’s parish was created on the 7th of August 2003 
                        by His Eminence Anthony cardinal Okojie, the then archbishop and the metropolitian see of Lagos. <br>
                        Since its creation, the parish has been a centre for true worship to God and human relationship, 
                        this is made possible because its nearness has reduced the suffering of many worshippers that 
                        do go to far distant parish to enjoy sunday Masses and other spiritual activities of the catholic 
                        community.<br>
                        Our parish activities such as Eucharistic adoration, bible studies/discussion, novenas to our mother Mary 
                        , daily morning and evening masses have gone a long way to reshape the spiritual level of the parishioners 
                        and love for God and humanity.

                        Very Rev. Fr Christian Echewodo (aka Ichie 1), is the current parish priest of St Anthony AIT Road

                        acumen which he disposes in his role of shepherding God's flock. St Anthony’sparishoners cannot stop thanking 
                        God for the gift of Fr Ichie in this parish. We pray that God will continue to keep and guide him in his vocation.

                        Mr Ignatius Ayola, is a trained catechist in the catholic church.  Over the years, Ignatius as the catechist of this parish 
                        has contributed immensely in uplifting the faith of the parishoners, ranging from the catechism class preparation for 
                        the catechumen, marriage course and many other services to God and humanity. Caty, as he is fondly called is man that
                        accommodates everyone that comes around him, but you must be devoid of lies and other immoral attitudes.
