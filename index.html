                        We thank God for the wonders He is doing in our parish through His amiable and workaholic servant
                        Very Rev. Fr Christian Echewodo (Ichie 1); who apart from his spiritual endowments have been working 
                        tirelessly on different projects. Noteable among them are the newly built gigantic and beautiful 
                        Eucharistic adoration chapel, Our lady of Fatima's grotto, parish office, parish convenience and 
                        the interlocking of the entire church compound. <br>
                        The above mentioned projects was built within the space one less than one year. They were all commissioned 
                        by His Grace Alfred Adewale Martins, Catholic Archbishop of the Lagos Metropolitian See, on the 7th Of July
                        2022. To God be the glory!, amen. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we thank our parishoners for their generous support in making the success so far, we also appeal 
                        to them to also support our upcoming projects mostly the renovation of our church building and the special 
                        support for the less privillege (currently going on every sunday). Our annual free medical outreach should not also be 
                        forgotten. May the good Lord continue to bless and provide for you as support His work.
