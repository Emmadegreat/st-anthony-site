                    <h2>The great commandment (Matth. 22:36-40)</h2>
                    <img src="https://assets.ldscdn.org/dd/7c/dd7c451e21c9aac3b55aa6ab43ba69c60a878a9d/dd7c451e21c9aac3b55aa6ab43ba69c60a878a9d.jpeg" alt="img" class="img">
                    <p>
                        “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Jesus replied: “ ‘Love
                        the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your
                        mind.’  This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like
                        it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on
                        these two commandments.” <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                        Jesus gives us two commandments that summarize all the laws and commands in
                        Scripture. The Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 deal with our relationship with
                        God and then our relationship with other people. One naturally flows out of
                        the other. Without a right relationship with God, our relationships with others
                        will not be right, either. The cause of the world’s problems is that man needs
                        to be reconciled to God. We will never love our neighbor as ourselves if we do
                        not first love God with all our heart, mind, and soul. All of man’s best efforts
                        toward world peace will fail as long as men are living in rebellion against God. <br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked by another Pharisee how one could “inherit eternal
                        life,” Jesus answered that it is by keeping these two commandments (Luke 10:25–37).
                        Only two commandments to obey, yet how often do we, like this Pharisee, try to “justify”
                        ourselves because saying we obey these commandments is much easier than really living
                        according to them.

                    <h2>Reflection: I come to set the world on fire(Lk 12:49)</h2>
                    <img src="http://joyintruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fire2.jpg" alt="img" class="img">

                        With this curious statement, Jesus reveals a key part
                        of his purpose. The context gives the meaning. Just after
                        this, he speaks of the baptism that he will suffer and of
                        his great distress in anticipation of it. We can only assume
                        he is speaking of the cross. Along with being abandoned, rejected,
                        brutally tortured, and crucified, he will have to take the sin of
                        the world into his being, and then experience the wrath of his Holy
                        Father for that sin. This will have the effect of casting fire on the
                        earth and drawing a line between the world and the Church, believers
                        and unbelievers, God-lovers, and God-haters.

                        He is anxious to be about his business, not only to get through the severe
                        suffering for himself that it will entail, but also because God’s purposes
                        are good and are the ultimate remedy for the great tragedy of sin since the
                        garden. Jesus is eager to see the will of God accomplished, and so should we
                        be eager for the same. Perhaps for us, the question would be, do we want to
                        see Jesus return to finish his work, though it means the end of things as we

                        know? Undoubtedly, some who are suffering in this life, especially from injustice,
                        will say, “Yes Lord, come soon!” Others, who are enjoying this good life that God
                        has given us, will need to have the faith to pray that Jesus would return. Be comforted
                        by the fact that whatever we like about this world and our current existence pales in
                        comparison to what it will be like in the new heavens and the new earth. On-the-other hand,
                        all of us know and love unbelievers for whom we fear should the Lord return today. It is good
                        that we can trust his sovereign will and judgment in the matter of when to send his Son again
                        from heaven.

                    <h2>The position of the church on the national security</h2>
                    <img src="../images/church1.jpg" alt="img" class="img">
                    <p>
                        National Security, which occupies the highest level of priority in the
                        hierarchy of interests for any society, is a major concern of Government.
                        The safety of life and property of citizens and provision of an environment
                        devoid of danger, is the primary responsibility of those persons entrusted
                        with the privilege to govern. It is one of the core values that States cherish
                        as non-negotiable, and that do not admit compromises. This fact is made important
                        in Section 4 of the 1999 Nigerian constitution as amended.

                        According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
                        Affairs (UN OCHA), national security entails a wide range of security areas
                        such as; <br>

                        Economic: creation of employment and measures against poverty. <br>
                        Food: measures against hunger and famine. <br>
                        Health: measures against disease, unsafe food, malnutrition and lack of access to basic health care. <br>
                        Environmental: measures against environmental degradation, resource depletion, natural disasters and pollution. <br>
                        Personal: measures against physical violence, crime, terrorism, domestic violence and child labour. <br>
                        Community: measures against inter-ethnic, religious and other identity tensions. <br>
                        Political: measures against political repression and human rights abuses. <br>
                        It is evident that Nigeria today, is struggling with all of the above areas that make up national security. <br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;There is a general tendency in Nigeria and perhaps, in most developing countries, to equate military
                        security with national security whereas national security is all embracing of the seven segments
                        listed above. None of them can stand alone, as they are indeed interconnected. It is, therefore,
                        futile to think that once the military are moved to troubled areas, the country is secure.

                        Presently food inflation stands at nearly 20%, with most citizens unable to afford a regular and balanced
                        diet, travelling in Nigeria is fraught with danger and uncertainty, apart from the appalling road infrastructure,
                        even at home, life is not safe because armed robbers, assassins, Boko Haram, kidnappers, herdsmen and murderers
                        can strike at any time of the day. Peace has become elusive and a mirage. <br>
