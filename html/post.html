                        With this curious statement, Jesus reveals a key part 
                        of his purpose. The context gives the meaning. Just after 
                        this, he speaks of the baptism that he will suffer and of 
                        his great distress in anticipation of it. We can only assume 
                        he is speaking of the cross. Along with being abandoned, rejected, 
                        brutally tortured, and crucified, he will have to take the sin of 
                        the world into his being, and then experience the wrath of his Holy 
                        Father for that sin. This will have the effect of casting fire on the 
                        earth and drawing a line between the world and the Church, believers 
                        and unbelievers, God-lovers, and God-haters.

                        He is anxious to be about his business, not only to get through the severe 
                        suffering for himself that it will entail, but also because God’s purposes
                        are good and are the ultimate remedy for the great tragedy of sin since the
                        garden. Jesus is eager to see the will of God accomplished, and so should we
                        be eager for the same. Perhaps for us, the question would be, do we want to
                        see Jesus return to finish his work, though it means the end of things as we
                            
                        know? Undoubtedly, some who are suffering in this life, especially from injustice, 
                        will say, “Yes Lord, come soon!” Others, who are enjoying this good life that God 
                        has given us, will need to have the faith to pray that Jesus would return. Be comforted
                        by the fact that whatever we like about this world and our current existence pales in 
                        comparison to what it will be like in the new heavens and the new earth. On-the-other hand, 
                        all of us know and love unbelievers for whom we fear should the Lord return today. It is good 
                        that we can trust his sovereign will and judgment in the matter of when to send his Son again 
                        from heaven.
