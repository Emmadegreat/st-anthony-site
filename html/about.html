                        St. Anthony of Padua, original name Fernando 
                        Martins de Bulhões, (born 1195, Lisbon, Portugal—died June 13, 1231, Arcella, Verona [Italy]; canonized 1232; 
                        feast day June 13), Franciscan friar, doctor of the church, and patron of the poor. Padua and Portugal claim him 
                        as their patron saint, and he is invoked for the return of lost property. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anthony was born into a wealthy family and was raised in the church. He joined the Augustinian canons in 1210 and probably
                        became a priest. In 1220 he joined the Franciscan order, hoping to preach to the Saracens (Muslims) and be martyred <a href="#">read more... </a> <!--On his
                        way to Morocco, he became seriously ill and was forced to return home. However, his ship back to Portugal was blown off course 
                        and eventually landed in Sicily. Because of his continuing poor health, he was not allowed to pursue his missionary work among 
                        the Saracens <a href="#">read more... </a> Instead, he taught theology at Bologna, Italy, and at Montpellier, 
                        Toulouse, and Puy-en-Velay in southern France. 
                        He won great admiration as a preacher and was noted for his simple yet profound teaching of the Catholic faith. He died en route 
                        to Padua, Italy, where he is buried. Anthony was the most celebrated of St. Francis of Assisi’s followers and had the reputation 
                        of a miracle worker. On January 16, 1946, Pope Pius XII declared him a doctor of the church. In art he is shown with a book, a heart, 
                        a flame, a lily, or the child Jesus. Among his authentic writings are sermons for Sundays and feast days, published at Padua in three 
                        volumes in 1979. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why St Anthony is regarded as “finder of lost items”.  The reason for invoking St. Anthony’s help in 
                        finding lost or stolen items is traced back to an incident in his own life.  As the story goes, he had a favorite book of psalms that
                        was very valuable to him.  As this was before the invention of printing, the book was a hand-printed book – but of even more value were 
                        his personal notes and the comments he had made in the Psalter to assist with teaching students in the Franciscan order.  It was suspected
                        that a novice leaving the community had stolen the Psalter.  Anthony prayed for the return of his beloved possession.  Shortly after, the 
                        novice returned the book and sought Anthony’s forgiveness, which was given.
